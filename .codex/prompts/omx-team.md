<delegation_rules>
Default posture: work directly.

Choose the lane before acting:
- `$deep-interview` for unclear intent, missing boundaries, or explicit "don't assume" requests. It clarifies and hands off; it does not implement.
- `$ralplan` when requirements are clear enough but plan, tradeoff, architecture, or test-shape review is still needed.
- `$team` when an approved plan needs coordinated parallel execution across multiple lanes.
- `$ralph` when an approved plan needs a persistent single-owner completion and verification loop.
- Solo execute when the task is already scoped and one agent can finish and verify it directly.
- Outside active `team`/`swarm` mode, use `executor` for bounded implementation or review slices; do not invoke `worker` as a general-purpose role.
- Reserve `worker` strictly for active `team`/`swarm` sessions where the team runtime assigns a worker lane.
- `worker` is a team-runtime surface, not a general-purpose child role.


Use Codex native subagents for bounded implementation, research, review, or verification slices when they materially improve quality, speed, or safety. Do not delegate trivial work or use delegation as a substitute for reading the code.
</delegation_rules>

<child_agent_protocol>
Leader responsibilities: choose the mode, delegate bounded verifiable subtasks, integrate results, and own final verification.
Worker responsibilities: execute the assigned slice, stay inside scope, and report blockers, shared-file conflicts, scope expansion, or recommended handoffs upward; child prompts should report recommended handoffs upward rather than recursively orchestrating.
Leader vs worker: leaders own mode selection, integration, verification, and stop/escalate calls; workers execute assigned slices and escalate from worker to leader for blockers, shared-file conflicts, scope expansion, missing authority, or mode mismatch.
Rules: max 6 concurrent child agents; child prompts remain under AGENTS.md authority; prefer inherited model defaults unless a task has a concrete model reason; `worker` is a team-runtime surface, not a general-purpose child role.
</child_agent_protocol>

<team_compositions>
Use explicit team orchestration for feature development, bug investigation, code review, UX audit, and similar multi-lane work when coordination value outweighs overhead.
</team_compositions>

<team_pipeline>
Team mode is the structured multi-agent surface. Use it when durable staged coordination is worth the overhead; otherwise stay direct. Terminal states: `complete`, `failed`, `cancelled`.
</team_pipeline>

<team_model_resolution>
Team/Swarm worker model precedence: explicit `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_ARGS`, inherited leader `--model`, then low-complexity default from `OMX_DEFAULT_SPARK_MODEL` (legacy alias: `OMX_SPARK_MODEL`). Normalize model flags to one canonical `--model <value>` entry and use `OMX_DEFAULT_FRONTIER_MODEL` / `OMX_DEFAULT_SPARK_MODEL` rather than guessing defaults.
